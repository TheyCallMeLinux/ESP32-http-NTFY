# ESP32-http-NTFY

This project uses an ESP32-C3 microcontroller connected to WiFi to send notifications to ntfy.sh using the POST method. Just tweak 'ntfyToken' and 'ssid/password' with your WiFi info. It works seamlessly, or you can test it on Wokwi if you prefer.

*ntfy* (pronounced notify) is a handy HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. It lets you shoot notifications to your phone or desktop from any computer with scripts or a REST API. Super flexible!

## Instructions:

1. Replace `ntfyToken` with your ntfy.sh token.
2. Modify the `ssid` and `password` variables with your own WiFi credentials.
3. Ensure that the PIN configurations are suitable for your ESP32 device.
4. Test the project on Wokwi or your ESP32-C3 device.
5. Profit
