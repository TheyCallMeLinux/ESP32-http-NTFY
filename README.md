# ESP32-http-NTFY

Uses an ESP32-C3  (PIN modifications might be required if you uses another device) with WiFi to publish on ntfy.sh using POST. Just edit stuff like "ntfyToken" and "ssid"/"password" of your own WiFi and it should be good to go or try it on Wokwi. 

## Instructions:

1. Replace `ntfyToken` with your ntfy.sh token.
2. Modify the `ssid` and `password` variables with your own WiFi credentials.
3. Ensure that the PIN configurations are suitable for your ESP32 device.
4. Test the project on Wokwi or your ESP32-C3 device.
5. Profit
